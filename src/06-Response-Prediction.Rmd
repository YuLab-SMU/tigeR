# ðŸ”® Response Prediction
â€ƒ**pred_response** function predicts the immunotherapy response for the patients from gene expression data using our pre-trained machine learning models or public gene expression signatures.
```{r include=FALSE}
library(tigeR)
library(tigeR.data)
```
â€ƒThe ipt signature is derived from multi-modal data, which includes bulk RNA-seq, tumor microenvironment information, and clinical data, collected from 275 melanoma patients who underwent Immune checkpoint blockade treatment. A Random Forest model was constructed to conduct feature selection and create the signature.
```{r echo=TRUE}
pred_response(SE=MEL_GSE93157,Signature = ipt,
              method = "Weighted_mean",threshold = 0.8,
              PT_drop = FALSE,sort_by = "Customed.Signature",
              group_by = "Customed.Signature",show.Observed = TRUE,
              rankscore = FALSE)
