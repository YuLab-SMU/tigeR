# ðŸ”® Response Prediction
â€ƒ**pred_response** function predicts the immunotherapy response for the patients from gene expression data using our pre-trained machine learning models or public gene expression signatures.

â€ƒThe ipt signature is derived from multi-modal data, which includes bulk RNA-seq, tumor microenvironment information, and clinical data, collected from 275 melanoma patients who underwent Immune checkpoint blockade treatment. A Random Forest model was constructed to conduct feature selection and create the signature.
